# VaR Model - Historical, Parametric and Monte Carlo

This project implements a Value at Risk (VaR) model at a 95% confidence level using three methods: Historical Simulation, Parametric, and Monte Carlo.

It uses Yahoo Finance as the data source and contains functions to calculate the 1-day VaR for the S&P 500 (SPY ETF).

I plan on expanding this work to include a portfolio of assets rather than just a single asset.
